PLP Bookstore MongoDB Implementation
Overview
This project demonstrates a complete MongoDB implementation for a bookstore database, covering all essential database operations from basic CRUD to advanced analytics and performance optimization.

Features
Full CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete book documents

Advanced Querying: Complex filtering, sorting, and pagination

Data Aggregation: Powerful grouping and statistical analysis

Performance Optimization: Index creation and query analysis

Structured Output: Clean console formatting with execution statistics

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js v14+

npm (included with Node.js)

MongoDB Atlas cluster or local MongoDB instance

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plp-bookstore-mongodb.git
cd plp-bookstore-mongodb
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install
Configure your MongoDB connection:

Update the connection URI in queries.js

For security, use environment variables in production

Usage
Run the complete implementation:

bash
node queries.js
What It Does
The script executes all operations in this sequence:

Creates sample book data

Performs basic CRUD operations

Runs advanced queries

Executes aggregation pipelines

Creates indexes and analyzes performance

Customization
Modify these parameters in queries.js to test different scenarios:

javascript
// Example customizations:
await findBooksByGenre("Science Fiction");
await findBooksPublishedAfter(2020);
await updateBookPrice("The Hobbit", 25.99);
Performance Tips
Indexing: Create indexes on frequently queried fields

Projection: Only request necessary fields

Pagination: Implement skip/limit for large datasets

Batch Operations: Use bulk writes for multiple documents

Best Practices
Security:

Use environment variables for credentials

Implement proper user roles

Enable network IP whitelisting

Maintenance:

Regularly review query performance

Remove unused indexes

Monitor database growth

Development:

Use the explain() method to analyze queries

Implement comprehensive error handling

Document all schema designs
